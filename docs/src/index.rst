Turret style tool changer driven by stepper motor

.. info::
   The Litex-CNC project aims to make a generic CNC firmware and driver for FPGA cards which are
   supported by Litex. Configuration of the board and driver is done using json-files. The supported
   boards are the Colorlight boards 5A-75B and 5A-75E, as these are fully supported with the open
   source toolchain. The Litex-CNC project can be extended by custom modules, tailored to the need
   of the users.

   See the `documentation <https://litex-cnc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>` for a full description of
   Litex-CNC and its capabilities.
